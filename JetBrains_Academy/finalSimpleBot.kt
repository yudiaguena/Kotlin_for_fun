/*Hello! My name is Aid.
I was created in 2020.
Please, remind me your name.
> Max
What a great name you have, Max!
Let me guess your age.
Enter remainders of dividing your age by 3, 5 and 7.
> 1
> 2
> 1
Your age is 22: that's a good time to start programming!
Now I will prove to you that I can count to any number you want.
> 3
0!
1!
2!
3!
Let's test your programming knowledge.
Why do we use methods?
1. To repeat a statement multiple times.
2. To decompose a program into several small subroutines.
3. To determine the execution time of a program.
4. To interrupt the execution of a program.
> 4
Please, try again.
> 2
Congratulations, have a nice day!*/
